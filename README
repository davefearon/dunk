<h1>Welcome to Dunk!</h1>
<h2>A Ruby wrapper for the Dribbble API.</h1>

<h3>Why did I write this?</h3>
<p>Well in my ongoing effort to become a better programmer, I am going to attempt to start and finish a new project every 2 weeks.</p>

<h3>When will this be finished?</h3>
<p>Since I wasn't planning on starting this until the beginning of 2011, I'm not sure yet. My goal is to try and have this done as quickly as possible so I can come up with my next project.</p>
